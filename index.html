      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Computer Science major in Animation and Game Development graduate with a robust foundation in producing interactive and visually appealing content.

My skills include 3D modeling, character animation, game mechanics, and asset creation, all backed by a strong attention to detail and design. I am passionate about learning new tools and techniques to elevate the quality and performance of my projects. I am adaptable and eager to work on collaborative game development projects while continuously improving my technical abilities.</p>
